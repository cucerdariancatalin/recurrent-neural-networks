# recurrent-neural-networks
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that process sequential data, such as speech, text, or time-series data. RNNs use feedback connections to maintain a state that can capture information from previous inputs, allowing them to make predictions based on a sequence of inputs.
